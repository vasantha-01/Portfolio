                <h3>Debugging</h3>
                <p>In software development, the debugging process begins when a developer locates a code 
                    error in a computer program and is able to reproduce it. Debugging is part of the software 
                    testing process and is an integral part of the entire software development lifecycle.</p>

                <h3>Code Testing</h3>
                <p>Code testing refers to running each line of code with a controlled input, and verifying 
                    if it performs the expected output. The goal is to identify bugs or errors during the SDLC.
                    While code documentation helps others to understand what you 
                    expect your code to do, testing guarantees that it meets these expectations.</p>
